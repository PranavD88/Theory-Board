During the previous sprint, I accomplished solid progress both individually and as part of the team, particularly in implementing functionality related to creating, storing, and deleting directories and some files. These contributions were foundational to the system we are building and helped move the project closer to its intended goals. I felt a sense of ownership over these features and was glad to see them coming together through collaboration and iteration.

One of the main challenges I faced during this sprint was dealing with unexpected errors in the code. Sometimes, the system wouldn’t function as intended, and it wasn’t immediately clear what was going wrong. To address these issues, I relied on online resources and tools, diving deep into forums and documentation to explore potential fixes. This process taught me a lot about debugging, and I became more efficient at identifying the source of problems and testing different solutions until things worked.

Through this sprint, I also learned how to troubleshoot and fix specific coding errors that I hadn’t encountered before. These lessons were valuable not only in improving my technical skills but also in helping me become more self-reliant and resourceful. Understanding how small changes in code can have bigger impacts on the overall program structure helped me think more critically about the development process.

Looking ahead, one area I’d like to improve is my communication within the team. While I worked through many challenges independently, I realized that sharing more of my ideas earlier could have helped us move faster as a group. Additionally, I believe the team as a whole could benefit from more open dialogue about when to consult external resources like Google. Establishing a clearer process for collaborative problem-solving could enhance both efficiency and learning opportunities for everyone.

In the next sprint, I plan to engage more proactively in team discussions and make sure that my contributions are well integrated into our shared vision.
