During this sprint, I was able to accomplish and finish most of the project. My primary
contributions included making multiple note functionalities, stable node positions so that they
keep their position after refreshing or logging out, and logging in. I also added multiple graph
openings and a projects page so that you can now create multiple graphs instead of being
limited to just one graph.. Additionally, I added a search for notes using titles, added a search
bar to the navigation, and a daily streak counter for a gamified aspect. One UI improvement I
made was so that the nodes spawn in visible areas of the graph. Also, text fields clear after note
creation, making sure that users are better able to utilize the note creation function.

There were many challenges along the way, especially when working with the graph saving
positions and switching between the projects. It took time to debug the issues where nodes
would reset positions, or wrong project graphs would load. I fixed this by restructuring the
frontend state logic and making sure that project IDs were passed to API calls. Another
challenge was making sure that multiple note windows would not duplicate or overlap upon
creation, which required tracking open note states and making sure they matched up with the
graph nodes.

Throughout this sprint, I learned about frontend state management. I got comfortable with
creating features that keep data across sessions through backend integration and database
updates.

One area I could improve on again is putting in console logs while initially developing the
project, so that I will be more properly prepared for any issues that come across, and be more
prepared to debug. Also, I need to work better on breaking larger stories into smaller tasks and
working more collaboratively with the team.
