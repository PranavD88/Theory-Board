This project provided me with the opportunity to take on dual roles as an organizer and a developer. Using ClickUp, 
I managed and organized the development plans, breaking down tasks, setting deadlines, and tracking progress to 
ensure the team stayed on track. On the development side, I focused on creating a version of the text editor, a 
critical component of the project. This required me to learn a new programming language and framework, which was 
both challenging and rewarding.

The biggest hurdle I faced was setting up and understanding the new language and framework. It took time to adapt, 
but I eventually gained confidence in branching properly from the master repository and coding with TypeScript. 
These skills not only helped me complete my tasks but also deepened my understanding of version control and 
type-safe programming. However, I encountered significant difficulties with the Node.js file setup. A week was 
spent troubleshooting installation errors, which delayed my progress and highlighted gaps in my knowledge.

In retrospect, I could have improved by seeking more detailed guidance on installing and configuring critical files. 
Asking for help earlier would have saved time and allowed me to focus more on development. This experience taught me 
the importance of collaboration and not hesitating to ask questions when faced with unfamiliar challenges.

Moving forward, I aim to strengthen my understanding of file structures and setup processes, particularly for 
technologies like Node.js. I also plan to balance my time more effectively between project management and development 
tasks. This project was a valuable learning experience, helping me grow both technically and personally. By reflecting 
on these lessons, I feel better prepared to tackle future challenges and continue improving as a developer.
