Sprint Reflection
During this sprint, I contributed to the team by always being available to collaborate whenever needed. I actively assisted in debugging by analyzing code failures and providing reports on potential errors. Since we tested the program on different computers, I helped identify discrepancies in execution across different environments, ensuring that we could pinpoint missing elements and resolve issues collectively. My contributions helped streamline the debugging process and improve the team's overall efficiency.
One of the main challenges I faced was not fully understanding some parts of the code that were required for the project. At times, I struggled to determine exactly what needed to be done. To overcome this, I researched and studied the necessary code to improve my understanding and enhance my contributions to the project. Additionally, whenever I encountered difficulties, I actively engaged with my group, discussing the issues and seeking help when needed. This collaborative approach helped me resolve uncertainties and stay on track with my tasks.
During this sprint, I gained several valuable skills and insights. I now have a solid understanding of how to set up an SSH key properly, which is essential for secure authentication and working with repositories. Additionally, I learned how to correctly merge and pull code from the CELL machine, improving my ability to collaborate on shared codebases. Another key takeaway was setting up a new program on my system that allows me to run the given code efficiently. With this setup, I am now better prepared to modify and test the program as needed, ensuring smoother development in future sprints.
One area I could improve is my communication within the team. While I contributed to discussions and debugging, I could be more proactive in asking questions and sharing updates to ensure smoother collaboration. Additionally, I want to deepen my understanding of the code and the overall project structure. Strengthening my knowledge in these areas will help me contribute more effectively and with greater confidence in future sprints.
Overall, this sprint was a valuable learning experience. I played an active role in troubleshooting and ensuring our code worked across different systems. Although I faced challenges in understanding certain parts of the code, I addressed them through research and collaboration. I also gained technical skills, such as setting up an SSH key and properly managing code on the CELL machine. Moving forward, I aim to improve my communication and technical understanding to enhance my contributions to the team.
