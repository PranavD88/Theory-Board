During Sprint 3, my main contribution to the project was creating the foundation of the tagging system for notes. This allows users to create tags associated with individual notes. Although the full functionality, such as editing or deleting tags, was not completed during this sprint, the groundwork for it was built out in both the frontend and the backend, and you can make the tags yourself. You can also put multiple tags for a note instead of just one tag.
To create this, I created routes and controllers in the backend to handle the tag creation and retrieval, making sure that each tag was tied to each note and to each individual user. In the frontend, I added a tag input section in the note creation section, which allows them to be dynamically created and added to a note upon creation.
One of the main challenges I faced in this sprint was integrating the tagging system with the existing note structure. Since the note interface had already been established, I had to restructure parts of the database and modify certain React components so that it would not break any existing functionality. This was accomplished properly and did not result in any bugs while doing so.
During this Sprint, I learned how to extend a PostegreSQL schema in order to include relational data (tags linked to user notes). I also improved my skills in making API calls in React using async/await and updating shared state.
What I could have improved in this sprint was my planning and communication. A majority of this Sprint could have been accomplished a lot faster if the team had communicated better, but we finally started communicating properly near the end of the Sprint, so then I was able to start accomplishing more work, and I was able to implement the tagging system.
