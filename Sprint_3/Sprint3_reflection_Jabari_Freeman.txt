During this sprint, I focused on revisiting the project management page, aiming to improve its functionality and usability. Additionally, I assisted a teammate who was struggling with accessing our shared files, guiding them through the process to ensure they could navigate our resources effectively. This experience reinforced the importance of teamwork and knowledge-sharing within our group.

One of my biggest challenges this sprint was attempting to create a new instance of the graph within our project. Despite my efforts, I encountered difficulties in implementing it correctly. Recognizing that I might not be the most qualified person to handle this task, I decided to reach out to my teammates to see if someone else had more experience with this aspect of the project. This decision not only helped resolve the issue more efficiently but also highlighted the value of leveraging each team member’s strengths.

Through these experiences, I learned two key lessons. First, asking for help when facing obstacles is crucial—it saves time and leads to better solutions. Second, offering support to teammates who are visibly struggling fosters a collaborative environment where everyone can succeed. Small acts of assistance, like helping a teammate access files, can significantly improve workflow and morale.

Looking ahead, I believe I can improve by communicating with my team earlier in the project lifecycle. Specifically, I should take the initiative to understand the tools and technologies my teammates plan to use before diving into tasks. This proactive approach would better prepare me to assist others and contribute effectively. Moving forward, I aim to engage in more preliminary discussions to align our strategies and ensure smoother collaboration in future sprints.
