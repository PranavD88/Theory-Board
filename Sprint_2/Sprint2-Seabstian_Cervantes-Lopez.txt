In Sprint 2, my direct contributions to the project were limited, but I made an effort to stay engaged with my teammates and follow the development process. While I didn’t complete any major tasks, I took the opportunity to observe how my teammates worked, which helped me understand different aspects of the project. I also practiced writing some TypeScript code to get more comfortable with the language, as it was relatively new to me.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was keeping up with the technical aspects of the project. Since I am still in the early stages of learning TypeScript and React, I found it difficult to contribute meaningfully to the development tasks. However, I tried to stay involved by asking questions and keeping track of the project’s progress. Observing my teammates’ work allowed me to gain insight into best practices, such as structuring code efficiently and managing state within a React application.

Although I didn’t actively implement features, I used this sprint as an opportunity to improve my understanding of the framework and tools being used. I spent time reviewing documentation, practicing small coding exercises, and familiarizing myself with the project’s structure. This helped me gain a better foundation that will allow me to contribute more effectively in the future.

Moving forward, my main goal is to continue learning TypeScript and React, particularly in areas that will allow me to work more independently on the project. I also plan to seek more guidance from my teammates, ensuring that I ask for help when needed and clarify any uncertainties I have. Collaboration is a key part of software development, and I want to be more proactive in communicating with my team to enhance my learning experience.

In future sprints, I hope to take on more responsibilities and gradually transition from observing to actively contributing. By improving my skills and applying what I learn, I aim to become a more valuable member of the team. With continued practice and support from my teammates, I am confident that I will be able to make meaningful contributions to the project.
