In Sprint 2, I focused on enhancing the user interface of the web application, which included adding new pages, updating the themes, and learning 
how to modify the CSS of the node graph by referring to the documentation. These tasks allowed me to become more familiar with the front-end 
development process and improve the overall user experience. By working on these cosmetic features, I gained a better understanding of how to 
manipulate the visual elements of the application and ensure consistency across different components.

As I moved forward, I aimed to take on more complex tasks beyond just UI updates. In this sprint, I attempted to create a project storage system, 
which would allow users to save and manage their projects more efficiently. However, this task proved to be more challenging than I initially 
anticipated. My limited experience with the Typescript-React framework made it difficult to devise a working solution that I could confidently 
submit to the repository. I encountered several roadblocks, particularly when it came to dynamically instancing pages in Typescript and ensuring 
that the storage system integrated seamlessly with the existing codebase.

This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly researching potential solutions before diving into a task. I realized that I need to better 
assess my abilities and the complexity of a task before committing to it. Additionally, I learned the value of seeking help and collaborating with 
my team when faced with challenges that are beyond my current skill set. Effective communication is crucial in a team environment, and I need to be 
more proactive in reaching out to my teammates when I encounter difficulties.

Moving forward, I plan to improve my understanding of Typescript and React, particularly in areas such as dynamic page rendering and state 
management. I will also make a conscious effort to communicate more effectively with my team, ensuring that I clearly articulate any challenges I 
face and seek guidance when necessary. By doing so, I hope to contribute more effectively to the project and continue to grow as a developer.
